# Tic-Tac-Toe 

My project is a tic-tac-toe game. I made it using React, TypeScript, Firebase, and CSS Modules for styling. The application is authorized. The logged-in user can create a game room to play with another online user or play against the computer. Previous games are saved as a table and a graph shows the percentage of games won and lost
