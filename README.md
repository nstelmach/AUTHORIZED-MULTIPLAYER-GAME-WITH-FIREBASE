# MULTIPLAYER GAME WITH AUTHENTICATION

My project is a tic-tac-toe multiplayer game. I made it using React, React Router, TypeScript, Firebase, and CSS Modules for styling. Authentication is used in the application. The logged-in user can create a game room to play with another online user or play against the computer. The user can choose whether to play with "O" or "X", as well as reset the game or leave the room. Previous games are saved as a table in the "History" tab.

You can use this credentials:

username: user1@gmail.com
password: 123456

username: user2@gmail.com
password: 123456
