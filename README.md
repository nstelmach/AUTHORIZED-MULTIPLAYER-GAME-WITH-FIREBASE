# Tic-Tac-Toe

My project is a tic-tac-toe game. I made it using React, React Router, TypeScript, Firebase, and CSS Modules for styling. The application is authorized. The logged-in user can create a game room to play with another online user or play against the computer. The user can choose whether to play with "O" or "X", as well as reset the game or leave the room. Previous games are saved as a table in the "History" tab.
